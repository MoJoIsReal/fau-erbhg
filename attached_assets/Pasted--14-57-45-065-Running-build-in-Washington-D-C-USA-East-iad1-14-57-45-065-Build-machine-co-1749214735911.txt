[14:57:56.280] (!) Some chunks are larger than 500 kB after minification. Consider:
[14:57:56.280] - Using dynamic import() to code-split the application
[14:57:56.280] - Use build.rollupOptions.output.manualChunks to improve chunking: https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#output-manualchunks
