# Security Configuration

## Security Measures Implemented

### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ Admin authentication required for database initialization
- ✅ Secure session cookies with HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite flags
- ✅ Password hashing with bcryptjs
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ Protected API endpoints with authentication checks

### Security Headers
- ✅ X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- ✅ X-Frame-Options: DENY
- ✅ X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- ✅ Content Security Policy configured
- ✅ Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

### Data Protection
- ✅ Environment variables for all sensitive data
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials in source code
- ✅ Input sanitization against XSS attacks
- ✅ SQL injection protection via parameterized queries
- ✅ Error messages don't expose sensitive information

### Database Security
- ✅ Connection via secure environment variables
- ✅ Database initialization requires admin authorization
- ✅ Proper foreign key constraints
- ✅ No direct database access from frontend

## Environment Variables Required

All sensitive data must be configured as environment variables:

1. `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
2. `EMAIL_USER` - Email service username
3. `EMAIL_PASS` - Email service password
4. `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` - Cloud storage name
5. `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` - Cloud storage API key
6. `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` - Cloud storage secret
7. `ADMIN_EMAIL` - Administrator email
8. `ADMIN_PASSWORD` - Administrator password (hashed)
9. `ADMIN_NAME` - Administrator display name

## Database Initialization

After deployment, initialize database with:
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/init-db \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_PASSWORD"
```

## Security Verification Checklist

- [ ] All environment variables configured in Vercel
- [ ] Database initialized with secure credentials
- [ ] Admin login functionality tested
- [ ] Contact form spam protection active
- [ ] All API endpoints return proper security headers
- [ ] File uploads restricted to authorized users only

## Monitoring

Monitor application logs for:
- Failed authentication attempts
- Unusual database access patterns
- Error rates and suspicious activity
- File upload attempts by unauthorized users
