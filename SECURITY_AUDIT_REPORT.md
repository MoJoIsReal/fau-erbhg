# Security Audit Report - FAU Erdal Barnehage
**Date:** June 6, 2025  
**Auditor:** AI Security Assistant  
**Application:** FAU Erdal Barnehage Website

## Executive Summary
The FAU Erdal Barnehage website demonstrates strong foundational security practices but required critical fixes for production deployment. All high-risk vulnerabilities have been addressed.

## Critical Issues Fixed âœ…

### 1. JWT Secret Management (HIGH RISK - FIXED)
**Issue:** Fallback secrets used when SESSION_SECRET missing  
**Files:** `server/auth.ts:47`, `api/upload.js:26`  
**Fix:** Added mandatory environment variable checks  
**Impact:** Prevents JWT token forgery

### 2. CORS Policy Hardening (MEDIUM RISK - FIXED)
**Issue:** Wildcard CORS policy allowing any origin  
**Files:** `server/index.ts:12`, multiple API files  
**Fix:** Environment-specific origin restrictions  
**Impact:** Prevents unauthorized cross-origin requests

### 3. Information Disclosure (LOW RISK - FIXED)
**Issue:** Sensitive error details exposed to clients  
**Files:** `api/upload.js:79`, `api/documents.js:59`  
**Fix:** Generic error messages in production  
**Impact:** Reduces attack surface reconnaissance

## Security Strengths âœ…

### Authentication & Authorization
- âœ… bcrypt password hashing (10 rounds)
- âœ… JWT tokens with 24-hour expiration
- âœ… Role-based access control (admin/member)
- âœ… Protected endpoints require authentication

### Input Validation & Sanitization
- âœ… Zod schema validation for all forms
- âœ… SQL injection protection via parameterized queries (Neon)
- âœ… File type restrictions (PDF, Word, Excel only)
- âœ… File size limits (5MB maximum)
- âœ… Integer validation for route parameters

### File Upload Security
- âœ… Cloudinary integration with secure URLs
- âœ… MIME type validation
- âœ… File extension verification
- âœ… Memory storage (no local file persistence)
- âœ… Authentication required for uploads

### Network Security
- âœ… HTTPS enforcement in production
- âœ… Security headers implemented:
  - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  - X-Frame-Options: DENY
  - X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- âœ… Request size limits (10MB)

## Environment Security

### Required Environment Variables
All critical secrets properly configured:
- âœ… `SESSION_SECRET` - JWT signing key
- âœ… `DATABASE_URL` - Neon PostgreSQL connection
- âœ… `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` - Email service authentication
- âœ… `CLOUDINARY_*` - File storage credentials

### Production Deployment
- âœ… Environment-specific configurations
- âœ… Secrets validation on startup
- âœ… Error handling without information leakage

## Data Protection

### Personal Information
- âœ… Anonymous contact form option
- âœ… Email validation for event registrations
- âœ… Duplicate registration prevention
- âœ… Secure password storage (bcrypt)

### Database Security
- âœ… Prepared statements prevent SQL injection
- âœ… Connection pooling via Neon
- âœ… No direct SQL exposure to client

## Monitoring & Logging

### Security Events
- âœ… Authentication failures logged
- âœ… Failed JWT validations tracked
- âœ… File upload errors monitored
- âœ… No sensitive data in logs

## Risk Assessment

### Current Risk Level: **LOW** ðŸŸ¢

| Category | Risk Level | Status |
|----------|------------|---------|
| Authentication | Low | âœ… Secure |
| Authorization | Low | âœ… Proper RBAC |
| Input Validation | Low | âœ… Comprehensive |
| File Uploads | Low | âœ… Restricted & Validated |
| Data Storage | Low | âœ… Encrypted & Secure |
| Network Security | Low | âœ… Headers & HTTPS |

## Recommendations for Ongoing Security

### 1. Regular Updates
- Monitor dependencies for security updates
- Update Node.js and npm packages regularly
- Review Cloudinary and Neon security advisories

### 2. Access Control
- Regularly review user permissions
- Monitor authentication logs
- Implement session management best practices

### 3. Backup & Recovery
- Ensure database backups are encrypted
- Test backup restoration procedures
- Document incident response procedures

### 4. Monitoring
- Set up alerts for failed authentication attempts
- Monitor unusual file upload patterns
- Track API usage for anomalies

## Compliance Notes

### GDPR Considerations
- âœ… Anonymous contact form option
- âœ… Minimal data collection
- âœ… Secure data storage
- âœ… No third-party tracking

### Norwegian Data Protection
- âœ… Local data processing (EU region)
- âœ… Appropriate security measures
- âœ… Limited data retention

## Conclusion

The FAU Erdal Barnehage website now meets high security standards for a community organization platform. All critical vulnerabilities have been resolved, and the application implements defense-in-depth security measures appropriate for handling parent and school communication data.

**Overall Security Rating: A- (Excellent)**
